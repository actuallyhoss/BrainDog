/**
 * The first-party packs one at a time: `portfolio`, `people`, `money-core`, `estate` and `work`, each
 * as a document `@braindog/declare` reads (docs/04-PACKS.md §6, `loop/research-modules.md` §5).
 *
 * SPLIT FROM THE STARTER, NOT WRITTEN BESIDE IT. Every declaration and every seed here is taken from
 * `packDocument()`, so the five documents and the combined one cannot say different things about a
 * register. A declaration goes to the pack its body names with `pack:`, and a page or metric that
 * names none goes to the one pack whose registers it reads.
 *
 * ONE DECLARATION BELONGS TO NONE OF THEM. The project template reads tasks, money and services at
 * once, so putting it in any one of those packs would make that pack require the other two, and a
 * person who asked only for Work would be handed Money as well. It stays in the starter, and
 * `crossPack()` names it.
 *
 * `requires` IS READ FROM THE BODIES, as the agents pack's is written: every register a field points
 * at, a page requires or a metric reads, less the pack's own and the kernel's `session`. The document
 * format names packs it depends on and not registers, and a record whose lists came from the seed has
 * no `pack` row for them, so the document says `packs: {}` and the installer checks the manifest.
 *
 * FUNCTIONS AND NOT CONSTANTS, because `index.ts` re-exports this file and this file reads
 * `index.ts`: a constant computed here would run before the declarations it reads exist.
