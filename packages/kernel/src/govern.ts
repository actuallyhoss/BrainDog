/**
 * The decision gate: how a proposal becomes a change, or does not.
 *
 * THE RECORD ALREADY OPENS SUGGESTIONS FROM THREE PLACES — a delivery that failed eight times, an
 * ingest whose pattern is not trusted to write, and the weekly analyser's draft — and until this
 * file existed nothing could read one, let alone answer it. Every one of them was a message in a
 * bottle. That is the failure this closes.
 *
 * A DECISION IS A ROW, NOT A SIDE EFFECT. `D41` says what was asked, what was answered, why, by whom
 * and when, and the change it authorised happened in the same transaction. A product that applied a
 * proposal and recorded the application is a product that cannot answer "who decided this and what
 * did they say", which is the only question anybody asks six months later.
 *
 * A REASON IS REQUIRED AND IS NEVER A DROPDOWN. `requires_reason` is on every options body and the
 * gate enforces it for every kind: a decision with no sentence is a decision nobody can revisit.
 *
 * AND THERE IS A THIRD VERB. `defer` is neither yes nor no — it is "not now, and here is when to ask
 * me again", and it writes no event because deferring is not a thing that happened to the record. A
 * gate with only two verbs is a gate people clear by dismissing things they meant to think about.
